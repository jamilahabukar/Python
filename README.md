# Python Projects

### Overview

This repository contains Python projects related to both Marketing(main branch) and NBA(master branch) data analysis. Each project focuses on various aspects of data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python programming language.

## Marketing Data Analysis

### About the Analysis
The analysis involves several steps, including data cleaning, column renaming, data transformation, currency formatting, reordering columns, computing basic statistics, and saving the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

### Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis contains marketing campaign data with various metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, and spend.

### Analysis Steps
Import Packages: Import necessary packages, including Pandas for data manipulation.
Read in File(s): Read the marketing campaign data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Reorder Columns: Rename columns for clarity and consistency.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Clean the data by removing special characters, convert data types, and create new columns such as CPA, CTR, CPC, CPM, and Campaign Name.
Currency Formatting: Add currency symbols to relevant columns.
Reorder Columns: Rearrange columns for better organisation.
Basic Statistics: Compute basic descriptive statistics for the marketing data.
Save to CSV: Save the cleaned and transformed data to a new CSV file.

### Conclusion
The marketing campaign data has been successfully cleaned, transformed, and analysed. Insights can be drawn from the derived metrics, which can inform decision-making processes in marketing strategies.

## NBA Data Analysis

### About the Analysis
The analysis involves several steps, including data visualisation using histograms, scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps. Additionally, descriptive statistics and filtering techniques are applied to gain insights into NBA player performance.

### Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis contains NBA player statistics, including points scored (PTS), field goals made (FG), assists (AST), steals (STL), and other performance metrics.

### Analysis Steps
Import Packages: Import necessary packages, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Read in File(s): Read the NBA player statistics from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of player performance metrics.
Data Visualization: Visualize NBA player statistics using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar plots, and heatmaps.
Filtering: Filter the dataset based on specific criteria to focus on relevant data subsets.
Per Game Statistics: Calculate per game statistics such as points per game (PTS per game), assists per game (AST per game), steals per game (STL per game), etc.
Top Players Analysis: Identify and visualise the top players based on games played, points scored, etc.
College Analysis: Analyse player performance based on college attended, including average points per game.

### Conclusion
The NBA player statistics have been successfully analysed and visualised, providing insights into player performance, team dynamics, and college influence. The analysis can inform decision-making processes in team management, player recruitment, and game strategies.


# Overall Conclusion 
The data analyses for both the marketing campaign and NBA player performance provided valuable insights for optimising strategies and enhancing performance. In the marketing analysis, techniques such as data cleaning, metric derivation, and visualization were employed to understand campaign effectiveness and allocate resources efficiently. Similarly, the NBA analysis utilized descriptive statistics, visualizations, and per-game metrics to evaluate player performance and team dynamics. By leveraging data analytics, stakeholders in both domains can make informed decisions, optimise resource allocation, and drive success towards achieving organisational objectives.
